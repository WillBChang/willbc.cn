## Programming
I enjoy programming with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) for writing scripts, [JavaScript](https://javascript.info/) for building browser extensions and websites, and I'm learning [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/) for making iOS/MacOS apps.

I mainly use [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) to improve the productivity, [RubyMine](https://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/) to write Ruby & JS project, [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) to edit text, and [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) as web browser.

I'm building softwares to fill my personal needs, speed up my workflow, and trying to make a living. 

Check [Code](https://code.willbc.cn) for my programming projects.

## Music
I'm a fan of [Beethoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_van_Beethoven), [Glenn Gould](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Gould), I enjoy playing piano and composing music.

My lifetime's dream is to become a composer and I'm tring. I believe I'll get a Ph.D of Music Composition in the future.

## Writing
Novels are my favorite since childhood. I started writing(Chinese) poetry in 2010, also prose and short stories. [Jean-Christophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Christophe) influences me a lot, I have thoughts about writing a novel relative to it.

Check [Book](https://book.willbc.cn) if you can read Chinese.

## What else?
I'm also interested in Psychology, mostly Psychoanalysis, Cognitive Psychology, and Developmental Psychology. I'd like to get a master degree of Psychology before 30-year-old(2026).

My favorite anime is [JoJo's Bizarre Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JoJo%27s_Bizarre_Adventure), you should definitely check it.
